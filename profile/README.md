# Welcome To SynopticT
Oracle | PlayWright | Integration | Testing | Custom Apps

This is new... expect change. :-) 

# Ways Of Workking
- Use [this board](https://github.com/orgs/SynopticT/projects/1) to track tasks
- You can create "Issues" (higher level, like an epic), and "Sub Issues" (like a task)
- tbc: Pull Requests, branching strategies, repo rules, etc.

# ToDo - near term
- Use [the board](https://github.com/orgs/SynopticT/projects/1) instead of here for task management
- Keep this readme to a managble size, create seperate readmes as & when nesc.
- Develop repo WoW above
- Repo Template: PlayWright - started
- Repo Template: Node web app - not started
- Repo Template: Container app - tbc. Include Oracle Cloud CICD?
- Establish approach re password management

# ToDo - Future Ideas
- [Semantic Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)

# Decision Log
- Multi-repo as opposed to mono-repo. 
- Do everything on github when possible (project management, docs, etc.)
- Stick to Terraform where feasible. (Although what would we do if we found a perfect non-terraform example for something?)
